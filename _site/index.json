    "summary": "Maybe Unlike game engines (such as Unity, Unreal or Godot), MonoGame is a framework. This means it does not come as a standalone program that you download and install, and does not include a graphical user interface used to create games. Instead, MonoGame integrates into the standard .NET development workflow, offering a code-first approach to game development. This approach offers several advantages: Flexibility: Developers are not locked into using a specific editor or interface, allowing them to use their preferred development tools. Integration: As a .NET library itself, MonoGame can easily integrate with other .NET libraries and tools. Cross-platform Development: Since C# is cross-platform, and MonoGame is cross-platform, developers can develop MonoGame projects on Windows, macOS, or Linux, with only slight differences in the setup process for each operating system. Version Control Friendly: The code-first approach makes it easier to use version control systems like Git for your game projects. While the environment setup process is similar to the standard setup process for C# development, there are some MonoGame specific steps. These can vary slightly depending on your operating system and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Installing the .NET SDK The first thing we need to do is install the .NET Software Development Kit (SDK). To install it, follow the instructions based on your operating system below: Important As of MonoGame 3.8.2, the minimum supported version of the .NET SDK is .NET 8. Windows macOS Linux Open a web browser and navigate to https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download. Choose the version of the .NET SDK to install and click the Download .NET SDK x64 button to start the download. Note The minimum supported version is .NET 8 Once the download finishes, run the installer. Open a web browser and navigate to https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download. Choose the version of the .NET SDK to install and click the Download .NET SDK x64 (Intel) button start the download of the .NET SDK Installer. Note The minimum supported version is .NET 8 Once the download finishes, run the installer. Note For the time being, MonoGame requires that you install the Intel version even if you are using an Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Mac. For Apple Silicon Macs, it also requires that Rosetta be enabled. Open a new Terminal window Enter the following command to install the .NET SDK sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0 Note The minimum supported version is .NET 8 Install Additional Workloads (Optional) After installing the .NET SDK, if you intend to target mobile devices such as Android or iOS, you will also need to install the corresponding mobile workloads. To do this, open a Command Prompt or Terminal window and enter the following commands. dotnet workload install ios dotnet workload install android Install MonoGame Project Templates MonoGame provides project templates that can be installed to create new projects that are pre-configured to target the current version of MonoGame as a base to begin creating games. To install the MonoGame templates, open a Command Prompt or Terminal window and enter the following command dotnet new install MonoGame.Templates.CSharp Installing Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a free, lightweight editor. Depending on the programming language you are using, it is just a matter of installing the appropriate extension to support that particular language. VSCode is also cross-platform, meaning you can use it for development on Windows, macOS, and Linux. To ensure that all readers can follow this tutorial regardless of the operating system used, we will be using VSCode as our IDE. To install VSCode, follow the instructions for your operating system below: Windows macOS Linux Open a browser and navigate to https://code.visualstudio.com/. Click the Download for Windows button to start the download of the installer. Once the download finishes, run the installer. Open a web browser and navigate to https://code.visualstudio.com/. Click the Download for macOS button to start the download of the .zip archive. Once the download finishes, double click the .zip archive to extract the Visual Studio Code.app application package Drag-and-drop the Visual Studio Code.app application package into your Application folder to make it available in the macOS LaunchPad. Open a web browser and navigate to https://code.visualstudio.com/. Click the .deb download button to download the package for Debian based Linux distributions, or the .rpm download button for Red Hat based Linux distributions. Once the download finishes, open the package downloaded to install. Install the C# Dev Kit Extension For C# development using VSCode, it is recommended to use the official C# Dev Kit extension provided by Microsoft. Installing this extension will add additional features to VSCode such as a project system and Solution Explorer for C# projects. It also provides code editing features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, code navigation, refactoring, NuGet package management, and debugging tools. Note The Solution Explorer panel is a hierarchical view provided by the C# Dev Kit extension that displays your solution structure similar to Visual Studio's Solution Explorer. When you open a workspace in Visual Studio Code containing a .NET solution file (.sln), the Solution Explorer panel automatically appears and loads your solution. From this panel, you can perform common operations like: Adding new files. Managing project references. Viewing dependencies. Executing build commands. For more information about the Solution Explorer panel in Visual Studio Code offered through the C# Dev Kit extension, you can view the official documentation in the Project Management documentation. To install the C# Dev Kit extension, perform the following: Launch the Visual Studio Code application. Open the Extensions Panel by clicking the icon in the Activity Bar on the left or choosing View > Extensions from the top menu. Enter C# in the Search Box Click install for the C# Dev Kit extension. Figure 2-1: The C# Dev Kit Extension listed in Visual Studio Code Note When you search C# in the Extension Panel you may notice there is the C# Dev Kit extension and a base standard C# extension. When installing the C# Dev Kit extension, the base extension will also be installed as a requirement. Installing the \"MonoGame for VSCode\" Extension Throughout this tutorial, we will be using the MonoGame Content Builder (MGCB) Editor to add content to the game. MonoGame offers an official extension for Visual Studio 2022 that allows you to double-click the Content.mgcb file to automatically open it in the MGCB Editor. While there is no official tool for VSCode, there is a an extension developed by community member r88 to provide similar functionality and is regularly used by the MonoGame developers themselves. We will be using that extension throughout this tutorial. To install it, with VSCode open: Open the Extensions Panel by clicking the icon in the Activity Bar on the left or choosing View > Extensions from the top menu. Enter MonoGame for VSCode in the Search Box Click install on the MonoGame for VSCode extension by r88. (Optional) Install the \".NET MAUI\" extension to help with mobile development This extension is provided by Microsoft and is built on top of the C# and C# Dev Kit extensions. They will be installed as dependencies if they were not already installed. While primarily designed for MAUI development, it provides essential mobile debugging capabilities that MonoGame mobile projects can utilize. The .NET MAUI extension adds features for building mobile apps, including: F5 debugging support - Debug your MonoGame mobile apps on emulators, simulators, and physical devices Easy target switching - Change debug/deploy targets between different mobile platforms Enhanced C# Dev Kit integration - Leverages Solution Explorer, Test Explorer, and advanced language features Figure 2-2: The .NET MAUI Extension listed in Visual Studio Code Note This extension is recommended if you wish to do iOS or Android development. It is required for debugging support when working on mobile games. Setup WINE for Effect Compilation (macOS and Linux Only) Effect (shader) compilation requires access to DirectX. This means it will not work natively on macOS and Linux systems, but it can be used through WINE. MonoGame provides a setup script that can be executed to setup the WINE environment. Below you can find the steps based on your operating system. To do this, follow the instructions for your operating system below: Windows macOS Linux Note Setting up WINE for effect compilation is not required for Windows Open a new Terminal window and execute the following commands: brew install p7zip brew install --cask wine-stable xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine \"/Applications/Wine Stable.app\" wget -qO- https://monogame.net/downloads/net8_mgfxc_wine_setup.sh | bash Note After performing these steps, a new folder called .winemonogame will be created in your home folder. If you ever wish to undo the setup performed by this script, you can simply delete this folder. Open a new Terminal window and execute the following commands: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y curl p7zip-full wine64 wget -qO- https://monogame.net/downloads/net8_mgfxc_wine_setup.sh | bash Note After performing these steps, a new folder called .winemonogame will be created in your home folder. If you ever wish to undo the setup performed by this script, you can simply delete this folder. Creating Your First MonoGame Application With your development environment setup, it is time to create your first MonoGame application. Launch the VSCode application Open the Command Palette by clicking View > Command Palette or by using the keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+P (CMD+SHIFT+P on Mac). Type .NET New Project in the Command Palette and choose the .NET New Project command Next, you will be presented with a list of the available .NET project templates. Enter MonoGame into the prompt to filter the project templates to only show the MonoGame ones, then choose the MonoGame Cross-Platform Desktop Application project template. Note If the MonoGame templates are not showing up, then you skipped the step to install the templates, exit the project creation and click Terminal -> New Terminal in VSCode and run the following command: dotnet new install MonoGame.Templates.CSharp After choosing the template, a dialog window will appear asking you to choose a location to save the project, this is a folder where your projects will be created by default. Next, you will be prompted to enter a name for the project. Enter the name DungeonSlime, which will create your project in a new folder with the same name. If this is your first time creating your project, you will be asked to choose a solution format, simply select the default .sln option and click Next to continue. (This does not occur with subsequent projects) Finally, select the Create Project prompt. After selecting Create Project, a new C# project will be generated based on the chosen MonoGame template and opened automatically in VSCode. Figure 2-3: A new MonoGame project after being created in Visual Studio Code Now that we have the project created, press the F5 key on your keyboard, or choose Run > Start Debugging from the top menu. If prompted for a configuration, choose C#. The project will compile and run, displaying a screen similar to the following: Figure 2-4: The default MonoGame cornflower blue game window Be amazed, the default MonoGame Cornflower Blue game window. You have just created your very first MonoGame application. While there is not much happening here visually, there is a lot going on behind the scenes that the MonoGame framework is handling for you. When you ran the application, the following occurred: The application started The game window was created and graphics were initialized A loop is entered which performs the following over and over, until the game is told to exit: The game is updated The game is rendered to the window You can exit the game at any time by pressing the Esc key on your keyboard. Note Above, I mentioned that a loop is entered. This is commonly referred to as the game loop, which we will discuss in more detail in the next chapter. The reason the application enters this loop is because game applications work differently than traditional desktop applications, such as your web browser. Desktop applications are event based, meaning once loaded, they do not do much at all while waiting for input from the user. They respond to user interactions and redraw the window only when necessary. In games, things are always happening, such as objects moving around like the player or particle effects. To handle this, games implement a loop structure that runs continuously, first calling a method to update the game logic, and then a draw method to render the current frame, until it is told to exit. Conclusion In this chapter, you accomplished the following: You setup your operating system to develop .NET applications by installing the .NET SDK You installed the MonoGame project templates. You installed VSCode and the necessary extension to develop C# applications with VSCode You created and ran your first MonoGame project. Now that your development environment is setup and ready to go, you can dive in and start building your first game. In the next chapter, we will cover the contents of the Game1.cs file that was included in the MonoGame project you just created. Test Your Knowledge What are two advantages of MonoGame being a framework rather than an engine? :::question-answer Any two of the following: Flexibility: Developers can use their preferred development tools Integration: MonoGame easily integrates with other .NET libraries Cross-platform Development: Projects can be developed on Windows, macOS, or Linux Version Control Friendly: The code-first approach works well with systems like Git ::: What is the primary reason that game applications implement a game loop structure instead of using an event-based approach like traditional desktop applications? :::question-answer Game applications implement a game loop structure because games need to continuously update and render, event when there is no user input. In games, objects might be moving, animations playing, and physics calculating regardless of user interaction, requiring constant updating and rendering until the game is told to exit. ::: What is the color of the game window when you run a MonoGame project for the first time? :::question-answer Cornflower Blue :::"

    "summary": "CSS In this session, we'll take our first steps into the world of CSS – Cascading Style Sheets. You'll learn how CSS helps us style and design web pages, from changing colors and fonts to adjusting alignments and spacing. Let's make the web look good! Preparation \uD83D\uDCDA CSS Basics In the first video, we'll explore the different ways you can apply CSS to your HTML, understand how inheritance works, and get familiar with some of the most common styling properties. You can read about the concepts in depth here: Adding CSS to our document{:target=\"_blank\"} Using common selectors{:target=\"_blank\"} Inheritance{:target=\"_blank\"} Colors Next we'll look at how to work with colors in CSS. We'll cover three popular color formats: RGB, hex and HSL. You'll also get a quick intro to hexadecimal numbers along the way. If you want to know more, web.dev has a good resource on colors{:target=\"_blank\"}. The Box Model Let's explore the CSS box model — a core concept for understanding how elements are sized and spaced on a web page. You'll learn how content, padding, borders, and margins all fit together to shape every element on the screen. Web.dev also has a good resource on the box model{:target=\"_blank\"} that you can check out. CSS Selectors & Specificity Lastly, we'll look at CSS selectors and how they let you target specific elements on your page. You'll also learn about specificity and the cascade — the rules CSS uses to decide which styles win when there's a conflict. The concepts are also covered on web.dev: Selectors{:target=\"_blank\"} The Cascade{:target=\"_blank\"} Specificity{:target=\"_blank\"} Exercises Even More You Make your personal website from last session truly your own by styling it: Set a background color for the entire page. Change the text color of specific elements (e.g., headings or paragraphs). Choose a different font by updating the font-family and adjusting the font-size for better readability. Center some of the content, such as the main heading or introduction text. Style the included tables. Include margin, padding and borders on relevant boxes. Use custom properties for your websites colors. Come up with more styling improvements to your site! Share your updated work in the comment section below. Box Sizing The HTML below contains two boxes. Change the width of the second box to match that of the first box. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Box Sizing</title> <style> .box { text-align: center; border: 10px solid; padding: 50px; margin: 20px; width: 400px; } .alternate { box-sizing: border-box; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=\"box\">I use content-box box-sizing</div> <div class=\"box alternate\">I use border-box box-sizing</div> </body> </html> ??? note \"Solution\" css .alternate { box-sizing: border-box; width: 520px; } Sizing Units CSS gives you many ways to size elements. The most common are: px → absolute size in pixels % → relative to the size of the parent element rem → relative to the font size of the root (html) em → relative to the font size of the element Experiment with the website below, answering the following questions: What happens when you change the font size for the html element? Why? Change the width of the inner box to 200 pixels. How is this different from 50% here? Change the font-size unit of the inner element from rem to em. What happens? Why? Which unit scales when resizing the browser window? Why might rem be better for consistent typography across the site? What would be the issue of using pixel units across the site? When would you use pixels instead of relative units? <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> html { font-size: 16px; } .outer { width: 400px; height: 200px; background-color: lightblue; padding: 20px; font-size: 2em; } .inner { width: 50%; height: 50%; background-color: coral; font-size: 2rem; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=\"outer\"> <div class=\"inner\">Inner box</div> </div> </body> </html> A Taste For Selectors To practice your CSS selector skills, try out CSS Diner{:target=\"_blank\"} — a game where you have to select the right elements on a dining table using CSS! A Navigation Bar A navigation bar should be a list of links! Build a horizontal navigation bar using the list below. Style the bar with background color, spacing, and hover effects, and create a style that highlights the active page link. <nav> <ul> <li><a href=\"index.html\" class=\"active\">Home</a></li> <li><a href=\"services.html\">Services</a></li> <li><a href=\"about.html\">About</a></li> <li><a href=\"contact.html\">Contact</a></li> </ul> </nav> Here is an example of what the navigation bar could look like: It might be worth noting that you can use the display property to set whether an element is treated as a block or inline box. List items do not have markers when they are treated as inline elements. ??? note \"Example Solution\" ```css nav { text-align: center; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; background: #2196f3; padding-block: 1rem; } nav ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; } nav li { display: inline; margin: 0; padding: 0; } nav a { text-decoration: none; color: white; padding: 1rem; } nav a:hover { background: #1976d275; } nav a.active { background: #1976d2; } ``` CSS Zen Garden In this exercise, you'll use CSS to redesign the CSS Zen Garden{:target=\"_blank\"} webpage. The HTML{:target=\"_blank\"} stays the same — your task is to transform the look entirely through styling. We haven't covered everything yet (like layout techniques), so don't worry if your version isn't as elaborate as the examples on the site. Focus on practicing what you know and exploring what's possible with CSS! When you're done, host your site and share the link in the comment section below!
