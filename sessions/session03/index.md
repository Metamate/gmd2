- Inheritance vs Composition

## Today's Goal

Organizing and designing our game as it grows.

## Input

Separating physical inputs (Space Bar, 'A' button) from logical actions ("Jump", "Fire").

- Keyboard, mouse, gamepad input models
- Polling vs event-driven
- Binding input to actions
- [Command Pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html)
- Input buffering

## Inheritance vs Composition
Why deep inheritance hierarchies (e.g., Object -> Entity -> Movable -> Enemy -> Orc) become unmanageable.

Component Pattern: The shift from "is-a" to "has-a" relationships.
