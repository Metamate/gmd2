# Project

For the GMD2 course project, you will be implementing a 2D game using the MonoGame Framework.

Group size: 1-3 students

The goal of the project is to create a simple 2D game that uses best practices for organizing and architecting a game project. That is, the project must include gameplay systems and design elements solved through patterns and principles taught in the course. You have free choice in which type of game you choose to create, as long as you keep the above considerations in mind.

The source code of the project must be versioned using the git version control system and hosted on GitHub. By the final course session, the root of the repository must contain a README.md file containing key information on your project:

- A title and a brief description of the project
- A "how to play"-section (i.e. input, actions, game modes, etc..)
- A brief video demonstration of the project (hosted on YouTube)
- A link to a downloadable, playable Windows build of the project (hosted on itch.io)

The game project is used as reference and talking point at the exam and as such, can be worked on up until the day of the exam. It is however expected that students have a working version of the game to showcase at the final session of the course.
